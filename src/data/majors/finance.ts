            'In finance, AI appears first in workflows that process market prices, macro indicators, earnings releases, and news flow at high speed. Students often encounter this in investments, econometrics, and financial modeling courses where timing and signal quality matter.',
            'Professional teams use these systems to organize noisy, real-time information into watchlists, forecast updates, and risk alerts. The practical value is not perfect prediction but faster synthesis when markets move and assumptions need to be revised quickly.',
            'For undergraduates, this topic shows why modern finance is less about one static spreadsheet and more about continuous evaluation. Analysts increasingly spend time interpreting model output quality instead of manually collecting every input.',

          paragraphs: [
            'AI also appears in portfolio construction, where teams balance expected return, diversification, and downside risk across many assets and constraints. This is a common extension of concepts students learn in modern portfolio theory and factor analysis.',
            'In practice, institutions use AI-assisted tools to update allocations when volatility, correlations, or liquidity conditions change. These tools help compare many candidate portfolios more quickly than manual trial-and-error processes.',
            'For undergraduates, the lesson is that allocation decisions are iterative and data-intensive. Portfolio design is not just selecting assets; it is managing constraints, rebalancing rules, and changing market regimes.',
